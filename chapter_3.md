# Chapter 3: The Bone Mirror

The warehouse by the river wasn’t much—rusted beams, busted windows, a floor covered in dust thick enough to write my own obituary in. But it was quiet. Dark. Forgotten. A good place for someone who technically shouldn’t exist anymore.

At first, I didn’t look at myself. Didn’t want to. Every time I moved, the soft clicking of bone joints reminded me something was wrong. Every time my fingers tapped a metal surface, the sound was too light, too hollow. The glow coming off me cast long green shadows across the walls.

Denial became a full-time job.

But eventually, curiosity—or fear—won.

I found a bent sheet of aluminum wedged behind an old generator. Cleaned it off with a rag. Held it up.

And there he was.

Me.  
But not me.

A skull, glowing faintly like someone hooked neon lights through the bone. Hollow eye sockets burning with green energy. No skin. No beard. No face to hide behind.

Just… bone.

The metal slipped from my hands and clattered on the concrete. The sound echoed like a gunshot inside the empty warehouse.

Something inside me cracked.

I staggered back, knocking over crates and tools, pacing like I could shake the skeleton off if I moved fast enough. I tried covering my face with my hands, but that only made it worse—bone on bone, tapping like a metronome from hell.

“What did you do?” I rasped, though my voice didn’t quite sound like mine anymore.

## Attempts at Normal

Nonsense solutions came next.

Bandages.  
Masks.  
A hoodie pulled tight.  
A motorcycle helmet I found in a crate.

The glow seeped through everything—neon green bleeding like light through thin curtains. Nothing could hide what I’d become.

I tried brewing antidotes.  
Mixing chemicals until they smoked.  
Injecting myself with half-finished formulas.  
Downing liquids that smelled like rotten citrus.

None of it worked.

I wasn’t infected.  
I wasn’t poisoned.  
I wasn’t transforming.

I was **transformed**.

Permanently.

## Outside

That night, I wandered to the riverbank. The city lights shimmered on the water. I caught my reflection between ripples.

A glowing skeleton in a torn lab coat.  
No eyes.  
No nose.  
No expression.

Just a creature that used to be a man.

A stray cat hissed at me, terrified.  
Couldn’t blame it.

I almost turned back, almost accepted that maybe I didn’t belong anywhere anymore—not with the living, not with the dead.

Then something soft landed on my shoulder.

## Clunk

It was the pigeon—the half-starved one I revived earlier with a drop of the refined serum. One normal eye, one glowing just like mine. He settled his scruffy body against my neck like it didn’t matter what I looked like.

He didn’t flinch.  
Didn’t panic.  
Didn’t see a monster.

Just me.

For the first time since the lab, the world stopped spinning.

I let out a shaky breath—more a rattling exhale than anything human—and scratched Clunk’s feathers with my bony fingers.

“Guess you’re sticking around,” I said.

He cooed.

And in that tiny sound, something shifted.

Not acceptance—not yet.  
But a direction.  
A purpose.  
A thought that settled deep into the hollow of my chest like a seed:

If I couldn’t go back to who I was…

Maybe I could become something new.

Something useful.  
Something powerful.  
Something that wasn’t afraid of the dark anymore.

A **Skelly**.

The first of many.

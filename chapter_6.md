# Chapter 6: The First Hunt

The warehouse wasn’t quiet anymore.

Six resurrected misfits rattled around inside, testing their new bodies like kids with stolen fireworks. Goldie practiced his walk—smooth as butter but now glowing green. Dallas spun his bone six-shooter until the air whistled. Bjorn paced just to hear his own footsteps shake the foundation. Rattlebeard climbed the rafters. Skulljack revved his bike indoors until the lights flickered. Ironjaw did combat drills in total silence.

For the first time since waking up in that lab, the place felt alive.

Then the world reminded us it wasn’t done with me.

## The Energy Trail

It started with a tremor in my ribs—a vibration I recognized now as danger.  
Skel Energy wasn’t just power; it was a warning system. A sixth sense.  
And it told me something was closing in.

“Stay sharp,” I muttered.

Ironjaw froze mid-step.  
Dallas dropped into a shooter’s stance.  
Bjorn grabbed his axe like he was born holding it.  
Rattlebeard hissed something about bad omens.  
Skulljack killed his engine.  
Goldie spun his cane once, then stilled.

The warehouse lights flickered green.  
Clunk fluttered to my shoulder, tense.

Someone was outside.

Not random people.  
Not lost wanderers.

**Them.**  

The cleanup crew.

## The Sweep Team

Floodlights snapped on outside—blinding white beams slicing through cracks in the boarded windows. Shadows shifted. The distant thump of boots echoed across the riverbank.

Ironjaw’s voice dropped to a low whisper:

“Military formation. Two squads. Encircling.”

“Damn, they quick,” Goldie muttered. “Did you leave a forwarding address?”

I hadn’t.  
But apparently **Skel Energy leaves a signature**, and they had the tools to track it.

Blue laser-scanners swept along the walls.  
A metallic voice boomed:

**“Biotype-Unknown inside. Prepare containment.”**

Dallas cocked his revolver.  
Bjorn cracked his skull against a beam and roared.  
Rattlebeard yelled, “LET ‘EM COME!”  
Skulljack revved once—just enough to scare the silence.  
Goldie just grinned.

Ironjaw stepped forward, calm as a landmine:

“Orders, Skelton?”

I didn’t have any.

Not yet.

## The Breach

The warehouse doors blasted inward—metal shrieking, sparks flying.  
Four armored hazmat agents stormed in, weapons glowing with blue anti-energy charges.

Their lenses locked onto me instantly.

**“Target confirmed: Skelton.”**

The others stepped in front of me.

Goldie flicked his cane, glowing like molten gold.  
Dallas spun his revolver.  
Bjorn cracked his knuckles.  
Rattlebeard unsheathed a wicked bone hook.  
Skulljack revved louder, the wheels sparking neon green.  
Ironjaw planted himself like a fortress.

“Boys,” Goldie said,  
“we keepin’ the doctor alive tonight.”

## The First Battle

Everything exploded into motion.

Dallas fired first—green bullets streaking across the room like comet tails.  
Rattlebeard swung from a beam, dropping onto an agent in a clacking pile of pirate rage.  
Bjorn charged, axe raised, splitting the floorboards with each step.  
Skulljack popped a wheelie and slammed into a soldier full speed, neon sparks flying.  
Ironjaw disarmed another with machine-like precision.

Goldie danced through them, cane whipping through the air, deflecting stun bolts like a glowing metronome of violence.

And me?

I lifted my hand.

Green energy surged forward like a tidal wave.

An entire squad hit the wall at once—hard.

The room shook.

Silence followed.

Even the rain held its breath.

## The Message

The cleanup crew retreated, dragging their unconscious members, leaving scorched concrete and cracked batteries behind. One soldier shouted over his shoulder:

**“Skelton is hostile. Protocol Bonefire escalation approved!”**

They vanished into the storm.

Goldie twirled his cane.  
Dallas reloaded.  
Rattlebeard cackled.  
Bjorn demanded another round.  
Skulljack asked if he could hit someone *just one more time*.  
Ironjaw simply said:

“They will return.”

I stared out into the rain-soaked night, the glow in my bones steady and bright.

They knew I existed.  
They knew I escaped.  
And now they knew I wasn’t alone.

A hunt had started.

But they weren’t hunting a scientist anymore.

They were hunting **SkelCrew**.

And we were ready.

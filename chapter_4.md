# Chapter 4: The Accidental Powers

For days, I treated my new body like a malfunction I couldn’t debug.  
A glitch with bones.  
A bright green mistake.

I didn’t mean to test anything.  
Didn’t mean to experiment.  
Didn’t mean to discover a single thing about what I could do.

But my powers didn’t care about intention.

They showed up anyway.

## The Spark

The warehouse generator blew out on a cold night, sparks leaping like angry fireflies. I kicked the stupid thing out of frustration.

It came back to life.

Instantly. Violently.  
Humming like it just drank lightning.

A faint green pulse flickered through my hand.

I stared at my fingers.

“…That wasn’t normal.”

## The Strength

The next morning, I tried to drag a heavy crate across the floor—old scrap metal that might as well have been welded to the ground.

Instead, I launched it.

The crate sailed across the room and slammed into a wall like I’d thrown a cardboard box.

I froze.

Super strength.  
Me.  
A scientist who threw out his back once sneezing too hard.

## The Buzz

Later, as I paced, my thoughts sharpened in a way that felt unnatural. Fast. Clear. Loud.

A pencil on the table trembled, lifted an inch, then dropped.

I blinked.

“…Absolutely not. We’re not doing telekinesis. We are *not* doing that.”

But the serum hadn’t asked for permission.

It just rewired me.

## The Clunk Incident

Clunk—who had taken full advantage of his revived second chance—perched on a beam above me. He slipped off, wings tired.

I didn’t think.  
Didn’t react.  
I just reached out.

A green pulse shot from my hand.

He froze mid-air, wrapped in a faint neon shimmer.  
I pulled him gently toward me, like I’d hooked an invisible fishing line.

He landed on my shoulder, confused but unharmed.

We both pretended it was normal.

## The Realization

That night, I sat on the warehouse roof. Rain hissed as it hit my glowing bones, steam rising off me like I was a forge cooling down.

I held up my hand.  
The glow inside was steady now.  
Controlled.  
Mine.

I wasn’t just a skeleton.  
I wasn’t just a survivor.

I was a power system wrapped in bones.  
A tool waiting to be used.  
A force I didn’t understand yet.

Clunk nestled against my neck, warm in a way bones shouldn’t feel.

“We can work with this,” I whispered.

For the first time since the lab, I believed it.

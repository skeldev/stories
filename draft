# Chapter 1: How It Started

The lab was buried under Arlington, three floors down in a government building that smelled like old concrete and bad decisions. Rain always pounded the place like it had a grudge. I was Dr. Jeff Skelton back then—forty-seven, scruffy beard, eyes like I'd been punched by sleep for years. Project **Re:Life** was my job: some secret program to make people live longer by fixing cells that break down. Big money from suits who wanted to stick around for more meetings. **Formula-88** was my latest try—a green serum I cooked up with gene edits and weird particles. It glowed a bit, like cheap energy drink under blacklight. Supposed to patch up your body from the inside.

I was beat. Seven years of this, living on takeout and coffee that tasted like motor oil. It was around 2:47 a.m.—who knows, clocks down there lied anyway. I was dropping the serum into a dish, watching it spread like food coloring in water. Grabbed my mug without thinking. A drop from the pipette fell in. Didn't see it. Took a swig.

It hit fast. Warm at first, then burning, like I'd swallowed hot sauce mixed with battery acid. My vision went wonky, all green flashes. The heart monitor flatlined. Alarms went off somewhere far away. Then the whole room lit up green, and everything... stopped.

When I came to, it was quiet. Too quiet. I sat up, and my arms felt off—like they were too light, clicking at the joints. Looked down. My hands? Not there. Just bones. White, clean bones, with this faint green light running through them like bad wiring. Touched my face—felt the cheekbones, the teeth, nothing soft. The mirror showed a skull staring back, eyes just dark holes with a glow inside.

No heartbeat. No breathing. But I could think, clearer than ever. I heard the buzz in the lights, felt the hum from the machines like they were talking to me. Equations I'd been stuck on for months just clicked in my head. The serum didn't mess up—it changed me. Gave me this energy, what I started calling **Skel Energy**. Kept me going without food or air. Just needed a hit of the stuff now and then to stay lit.

I freaked. Tried everything—poked myself with needles, zapped with the defib, even called the emergency line and faked a normal voice. Nothing stuck. By morning, the cleanup crew showed up in their suits. "Lost the guy," they said, hosed everything down, locked the doors. Wrote me off as dead.

I wasn't. I got out through the vents, quiet as a shadow. Ended up in an old warehouse by the river, full of junk I could fix up. Started brewing more of that serum, turning it into something better: **SkelEnergy Drink**. Fizzy green cans, like a knockoff soda but packed with the real deal. One sip for the living? Turns you into living bones like me—stripped down, powered up, no more meat to slow you. For the dead? Pours life right back in, pulls 'em from the dirt glowing and ready.

Tested on small stuff first. A dead plant on the shelf? Sprinkled some—grew right up, greener than new. An old tool rusted solid? A splash, and it fixed like it was bought yesterday. Then there was this pigeon, half-starved, feathers falling out. Called him **Clunk**. Hesitated, but tipped a little on him. Next thing, he's flapping around, pecking at my fingers like we're buddies. "Guess you're with me now," I said. Even tried it on myself—kept the glow steady, sharpened the edges.

That's when it hit me. If I can fix a bird and a wrench, why not people? The big shots upstairs bury good ideas and smart folks under red tape and payoffs. I could pull them back with a can or two. Started calling it the **Resurrection Project**. Nothing fancy—just me, a cooler of SkelEnergy Drinks, sneaking around at night. Broke into museums, old churches, quiet graveyards. Picked the ones who mattered: thinkers, fighters, creators who got cut short. For the dead, I'd crack a can over the dirt or dust, watch the green fizz sink in. For anyone alive and game, hand 'em one straight—join the club, bones and all.

I'd leave a mark each time—a bit of green shine in the dirt, a quick skull drawing on the stone, and an empty can tucked nearby. Someone finds the spot, grabs a fresh brew from the drops I set up online, and they're in. Mint it on the chain like a secret handshake, and join the **SkelCrew**. My crew of bone-rattlers.

Word got around in the quiet corners of the net. Graves opening up late, people—or what's left—walking out, or folks chugging the drink and shedding skin like old coats.

First was **Tesla**. Found his spot in New York, simple dirt plot. Poured a can over it. Air buzzed like a short circuit. He pops up, clothes straight, looking annoyed.  
"You woke me for this?"  
I explained the plan—endless energy grid, no more power bills for the little guy. Handed him a spare can. He took a sip, grinned as his form sharpened to bones.  
"Alright, show me the wires."

**Da Vinci** was next, dust in a French chapel. Fizzed the drink in; he sits up, rubbing his hands like he's late for work.  
"Still dreaming machines."  
Gave him a can.  
"Fix this body."  
He chugged, sketched bone-wings and armor that moves easy.  
"Fun project."

**Marley**, up in Jamaica on a hill. Underground beat started thumping. Poured it over the ground; he comes out, hair with green streaks, air-guitar ready.  
"Feels right."  
Sipped another, tuned the drink's fizz to pulse like music.  
"We'll keep the rhythm going."

**Hawking** in London, quiet church spot. Cracked a can, linked it to an old chair setup—numbers popped up in the air. His voice box hummed:  
"This beats stars."  
He figured the math on how to keep the energy steady, one sip turning him skeletal and sharp.  
"No more falling apart."

**Tupac** last, back in Vegas cold room. Poured the drink; he steps out holding nothing, but words start flowing.  
"Lights on, but now it's green."  
Chugged his own, rapped a line that echoed electric through his bones.  
"Back for round two."

We met in whatever hideout I could grab—old docks, empty lots with lights I rigged up. Marley set the drink to a beat. Hawking figured the connections. Tupac wrote code in his rhymes. Da Vinci built me gear. Tesla hooked the power.

Me in the middle, Clunk on my shoulder. Up top, everything's the same grind—companies sucking life out, rules keeping folks down. Down here, we're changing it. One sip at a time.

**Life doesn’t end easy. Not on my watch.**

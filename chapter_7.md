# Chapter 7: The Hideout Below

After the breach, the warehouse wasn’t safe anymore.

Every glow I left behind, every echo of Skel Energy pulsing through the walls, every fight we finished left a signature the cleanup crew could track. They’d be back—with heavier gear, bigger squads, nastier protocols.

Ironjaw was the first to say it out loud:

“Location compromised. We relocate or we fall.”

Bjorn grunted in agreement.  
Dallas tipped his hat.  
Goldie sucked his teeth and muttered something about “government roaches.”  
Rattlebeard suggested we simply kill all of them.  
Skulljack revved his bike at the idea.

But they were right.  
Staying meant dying… again.

We needed a base.  
A place built for ghosts and things that refuse to stay dead.

So we moved.

## The Descent

Ironjaw led us through the outskirts of the city, down abandoned rail lines and forgotten drainage tunnels no one living ever bothered to map.

The deeper we traveled, the brighter our glow became—neon bones lighting the darkness like radioactive torches.  

Clunk flew ahead, scouting with sharp chirps, trailing faint sparks of green in his wings.

At the bottom of an old maintenance shaft, we reached it:

A massive underground structure buried beneath the city—  
an unfinished Cold War bunker sealed off decades ago.  
Reinforced concrete.  
Steel beams.  
Generators.  
Empty halls wide enough for a biker, a pirate, a cowboy, a pimp, a viking, and a soldier to walk side by side.

Skulljack kicked the huge blast door once, and it fell inward like it had been waiting.

“Home sweet home,” he said.

He wasn’t wrong.

## The Build

We lit the place up with Skel Energy.

My touch reactivated dead lights.  
Dallas and Ironjaw secured the perimeter.  
Bjorn smashed walls open for better airflow.  
Rattlebeard found hidden rooms no blueprint ever mentioned.  
Goldie decorated with glowing graffiti, calling it “branding.”

Within a few days, the bunker felt alive.

Not warm.  
Not friendly.  
But alive—buzzing with neon energy and the rattling sounds of our mismatched crew exploring their new domain.

The main chamber became our hub:  
a huge open space with concrete pillars, rusted catwalks, and enough room for Skulljack to park his bike without hitting anyone (usually).

I set up my lab in a corner—  
broken tables, old beakers, salvaged tools, and crates of SkelEnergy waiting to be refined.

Clunk made a nest in the ventilation ducts.  
He seemed proud of it.

## The Plan

Once the base was stable, the crew gathered around a repurposed metal table—scratched, dented, perfect.

Ironjaw placed a scavenged tablet on the surface.  
On the cracked screen:  
**surveillance feeds from above**.

Government vans sweeping neighborhoods.  
Drones scanning alleys.  
Special ops teams patrolling the riverfront.

They weren’t just hunting me anymore.  
They were tracing the **Skel Energy trail** we’d left saving people—reviving the lost, fixing the broken, leaving neon fingerprints on the world.

Dallas leaned forward, arms crossed.  
“Looks like you woke up more trouble than you meant to, Doc.”

Goldie tapped his cane.  
“Ain’t trouble if we choose it.”

Bjorn cracked his knuckles like thunder.  
“We fight.”

Rattlebeard slammed a bottle on the table.  
“Aye! They want bones? Let’s give ‘em bones!”

Ironjaw looked at me.  
“Skelton. Strategy?”

I didn’t have one—not fully.  
But I had an idea.

“We stop running,” I said.  
“We stop hiding. We build. We prepare. We help the forgotten—and we take back the one thing they don’t want people to have.”

Dallas smirked.  
“Freedom?”

“No,” I said.  
“Awareness.”

## The Mission Forms

That night, I wrote our purpose on the bunker wall in glowing green letters:

**WE WAKE THE WORLD.  
WE FREE THE FORGOTTEN.  
WE RESURRECT THE LOST.  
WE ARE THE SKELCREW.**

Clunk landed on my shoulder as if to approve.

The bunker hummed with Skel Energy.  
The misfits stood together—pimp, cowboy, viking, pirate, biker, soldier, and one glowing scientist who should’ve died but didn’t.

We weren’t hiding anymore.  
We were regrouping.

And from the depths of the earth, beneath a city that didn’t know it was sleeping…

we began planning our first move.

**The war hadn’t started yet.  
But the world was about to feel us.**

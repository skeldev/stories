# Chapter 2: The Cleanup Crew

By the time the sun clawed its way over Arlington, the lab I died in wasn’t a lab anymore. It was a crime scene wrapped in fluorescent lights and fear. Not that I was there to see it—I was already crawling through a vent a few floors up, glowing quietly like a radioactive night-light.

But if I’d stayed, here’s what I would’ve witnessed:

A matte-black van rolled into the underground loading dock, rain sliding off it like it wanted no part of what was coming. No plates. No markings. Government issue, the kind that shows up in movies right before someone disappears.

Four figures stepped out in armored hazmat suits—charcoal gray, faceplates shaped like insect eyes glowing cold blue. Not lab techs. Not medics. The kind of team they send when they don’t want survivors. Or witnesses.

They didn’t talk much. Professionals never do.

Inside the elevator, they scanned each other’s gear:  
A containment case.  
A scanning wand.  
A rifle that hummed with a frequency I felt in my skull even from far away.  
A metal cylinder labeled **BIO-NULL**—the kind you use when you want a room to forget it ever existed.

The elevator opened onto my floor.

The hallway lights flickered. Not from damage—just confused by the energy I left behind.

The cleanup crew entered the lab.

## The Investigation

**Crew Leader:** “Vitals?”  
**Scanner Agent:** “Negative. No body. No heat signatures. No organic residue.”

The leader knelt beside the workstation. My coffee mug still sat where I dropped it. The petri dish still swirled with faint green light. The cracked glass on the chamber door glowed softly.

The scanner beeped faster.

**Scanner Agent:** “…This isn’t normal.”  
**Leader:** “Define that.”  
**Scanner Agent:** “Energy signature present. Non-thermal. Non-chemical. Definitely not human.”

Another agent wiped a gloved hand across the floor where I collapsed. Green residue stuck like glowing sap.

**Agent 3:** “Contamination event.”  
**Leader:** “Then why isn’t the subject here?”

They followed the green smears to the vent shaft. The grate hung loose.

The leader lifted it with two fingers.  
More residue.  
More glow.

**Leader:** “Subject didn’t die.”  
**Rifleman:** “Impossible. Heart rate showed full arrest.”  
**Leader:** “Look around. Whatever he became… it walked out.”

The rifleman tightened his grip.

## The Decision

The leader tapped the comm on their wrist.

**Leader:** “Control, this is Alpha Sweep. We have a Biotype-Unknown escape. Subject Skelton not deceased. Repeat: subject not deceased.”

A long pause.  
Metallic static.  
Then:

**Command:** “Initiate Protocol Bonefire.”

The air in the room went still.

Protocol Bonefire wasn’t cleanup or containment.  
It was retaliation.

**Leader:** “Confirmed.”  
He turned to his squad.  
“Pack it. We’re hunting.”

They sealed the lab behind them—scrubbed, sterilized, erased. To them, the place was now a tomb.

But they never found a body.

Because I’d already crawled into the city above—barebones, glowing, scared, and somehow more alive than I’d ever been.

## The Beginning of the Hunt

Back in the warehouse that would become my home, I felt something twist inside my ribs. Not fear. Not pain.

Awareness.

Someone—some *system*—decided I was a threat worth erasing.

Not studying.  
Not saving.  
Erasing.

So I stayed quiet.  
Stayed hidden.  
Learned my new bones.  
Learned my new power.

While above ground, four agents in armored suits began tracking strange energy signatures across Arlington—glow marks on alley walls, faint pulses near storm drains, odd readings in abandoned lots.

Everywhere I walked, I left a trace.

Every trace led them closer.

And they weren’t stopping.

Not until they put me back in the ground they thought I’d crawled out of.

But I wasn’t done living.  
Or dying.  
Or whatever this was.

They wanted a monster.

They were about to get one.

**A glowing one.**

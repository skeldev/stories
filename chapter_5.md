# Chapter 5: The Bone Diggers

Knowing I had powers was one thing.  
Knowing what to do with them was another.

I wasn’t trying to build an army.  
I wasn’t thinking about justice or rebellion or changing the world.

I was lonely.

A glowing skeleton hiding in a warehouse, wanted by the government, haunted by the memory of my own human face.

But the more I walked the city at night, the more I realized something:

The world was full of stories that never got their ending.  
People forgotten.  
Buried.  
Discarded.

People like me.

So I began digging.

Not for heroes.  
Not for icons.  
For misfits.  
For personalities too loud for life to contain.

The ones the world would never resurrect—so I would.

## Goldie Bones — The Pimp

Chicago, behind a collapsed jazz bar.  
A neon sign half-lit above the dirt.

I cracked a can of SkelEnergy over the ground.  
The earth fizzed.  
A purple suit sleeve shot upward.

Goldie rose smooth as silk, brushing dust off his hat and flashing a gold tooth now glowing bright green.

“Damn,” he said, adjusting his collar,  
“Death really upgraded my style.”

---

## Deadshot Dallas — The Cowboy

El Paso outskirts.  
A forgotten grave under sunburned dirt.

One pour of SkelEnergy and the ground cracked like an old rib.  
Dallas sat up slow, tipping his hat, bones humming with power.

“Reckon I’ve been asleep long enough,” he muttered.

He hasn’t missed a shot since.

## Bjorn the Boneless — The Viking

Iceland.  
A burial mound frozen stiff as steel.

The serum hit the ground and the ice detonated.

Bjorn burst out roaring, beard crusted in glowing icicles, skeletal muscles flexing like he still had something to prove.

He did.

---

## Captain Rattlebeard — The Pirate

Caribbean coast.  
Sand swallowed him whole decades ago.

The SkelEnergy fizzed through the shore.  
He erupted coughing seawater he didn’t need.

“ARR— I be alive again?” he barked.  
Then laughed with a jaw that clacked like loose silverware.

---

## Turbo Skulljack — The Biker

Route 66.  
A collapsed overpass hiding a man and his rusty bike.

The moment the serum touched the dirt, his motorcycle roared awake with a hellish neon glow.

He climbed on without hesitation.

“Let’s ride,” he rasped.

And vanished into the night in a streak of green light.

---

## Sgt. Ironjaw — The Soldier

Bunker in the middle of nowhere.  
Dust thick as regret.

I poured the serum.  
He stood instantly—straight-backed, disciplined, with dog tags fused into his sternum.

“Awaiting orders, sir.”

The man didn’t even flinch at being dead.  
Or glowing.

---

## The New Crew

Back at the warehouse, they stood in a jagged line—six glowing skeletons from six different lives:

Goldie smoothing his suit.  
Dallas spinning a bone revolver.  
Bjorn cracking his neck like thunder.  
Rattlebeard adjusting his eye patch.  
Skulljack revving an impossible engine.  
Ironjaw scanning exits like a military drone.

Misfits. Outcasts. Legends in their own right.

Clunk perched on my shoulder, eye glowing softly.

I looked at them—my accidental army, my undead family—and said:

“Welcome to the SkelCrew.”

Six skulls nodded.

And for the first time since I died…

I didn’t feel alone.

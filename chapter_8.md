# Chapter 8: The First Mission

The bunker hummed with Skel Energy.  
Generators glowed. Pipes vibrated. The crew adjusted to their new home like they’d lived there in previous lives—maybe they had.

But I wasn’t building a glowing bone clubhouse.  
We needed purpose.  
Proof we weren’t just hiding from a government that wanted us dead and dissected.

And the world, as usual, didn’t take long to present a problem.

## The Signal

It came through Ironjaw’s salvaged comm system—a scrambled message looping faintly through old emergency channels.

A voice.  
Young.  
Panicked.

“…Anyone… please… trapped… they’re coming back…”

Dallas leaned over the console.  
“Sounds like trouble.”

Goldie smirked.  
“Trouble got good taste callin’ us.”

Ironjaw replayed the clip, enhancing the audio.

“…locked in… they shut the doors… please… if anyone’s out there…”

Rattlebeard’s jaw quivered.  
“Someone’s in a pinch. Always liked pinches.”

Bjorn stood, gripping his axe.  
“We rescue. Or crush. Both good.”

Skulljack revved his bike with a grin.  
“Let’s roll.”

But they all looked to me.

I didn’t hesitate.

“Suit up. We’re going topside.”

## The Abandoned Facility

The signal led us to an industrial sector on the edge of the city—a place where streetlights die young and the air tastes like dust and regret.

The building was an old biotech facility.  
Government-owned once.  
Privately exploited later.  
Now abandoned.

Or so they claimed.

Dallas scouted first, crouched behind cracked concrete.

“No guards outside. Quiet. Too quiet.”

Goldie twirled his cane.  
“Baby, quiet is just noise bein’ sneaky.”

When we got closer, I felt it:

A low hum. A familiar pulse.

Not Skel Energy.  
But something like it.

Someone inside had been experimenting.

On purpose.

And not ethically.

## Breaking In

Doors were locked with more security than the building deserved.

Ironjaw bypassed the keypad in seconds.  
Technically, he bypassed it by ripping the panel off and rewiring the entire circuit with his bare fingers. Efficient.

Inside, the hallways were sterile, cold, and lined with cracked windows. Papers scattered everywhere. Equipment unplugged, abandoned mid-process.

But the air stank of recent movement.

Clunk flew ahead, chirping in alarm.

Gamma lights flickered on.

Dallas raised his revolver.  
Bjorn raised his axe.  
Skulljack revved softly.  
Rattlebeard grinned like he smelled treasure.  
Goldie just strutted.

We found the room.

## The Survivor

A young girl—maybe thirteen—sat in the corner of a storage chamber, hugging her knees. The door had been welded shut from the outside.

Her eyes widened when she saw us—six glowing skeletons and one neon scientist entering like a bone orchestra.

She didn’t scream.  
Didn’t faint.

She stood up straighter.

“You’re… the ones from the rumors,” she said.

I stepped forward.

“You sent the distress signal?”

She nodded, swallowing fear.

“They locked me in. The men in suits. They said I had… an ‘abnormality.’ Something they needed to study. They left when the power went out.”

She looked at my hands.  
“They were trying to make more like you.”

My bones buzzed.

The government wasn’t just hunting us—they were trying to **replicate** us.

## Someone Returns

Before I could respond, Ironjaw stiffened.

“Footsteps. Multiple. Approaching fast.”

Dallas spun his revolver.  
Skulljack cracked his knuckles.  
Bjorn smiled in a way that should’ve terrified the air.

Goldie tapped his cane.  
“Doc, we protect the kid?”

“Absolutely.”

The girl hid behind me.

Rattlebeard whispered, “Ohhh, a fight. Haven’t had a good brawl since I died.”

The metal shutters dropped across the windows.

A voice boomed from outside:

**“Biotype-Unknown detected. Facility breach confirmed.”**

Government strike team.

Heavily armed.  
Heavily trained.  
Heavily doomed.

Ironjaw turned to me.  
“Orders?”

I looked at the girl, trembling but brave.

“We get her out,” I said.  
“And we send a message.”

The crew rattled with excitement.

## The Show of Force

The first soldier kicked the door.

Dallas shot the handle clean off.  
Bjorn slammed the door back into the squad.  
Skulljack drifted through the hallway like a tornado on wheels.  
Rattlebeard dropped from above, hooking a soldier off his feet.  
Goldie swiped someone’s legs out with his cane, smooth as silk.  
Ironjaw disarmed a second squad.

I raised my hand and unleashed a wave of Skel Energy so bright the walls shook.

Static filled the air.  
Soldiers staggered.  
Weapons fried.

The girl whispered, “Whoa…”

The strike team retreated, dragging their unconscious and fried equipment, shouting:

“Skelton is not alone! Repeat—Skelton has formed a unit!”

They fled into the night.

## The Aftermath

We left the facility behind, escorting the girl through the dark until we reached the hidden tunnel entrance leading back to our bunker.

She looked up at me.

“You… you’re not monsters.”

Goldie laughed.  
“Girl, we monsters with manners.”

Dallas tipped his hat.  
“Ma’am.”

Bjorn roared something that might’ve meant “welcome.”

Ironjaw said, “You’re safe now.”

Rattlebeard saluted with a bone hook.

Skulljack revved, which probably meant hello.

She smiled, small but real.

“What do I call you?” she asked.

I looked around at my mismatched family.

“The SkelCrew,” I said.

Her grin widened.

“Then I want to help.”

Clunk landed on her shoulder like he agreed.

We walked into the tunnels—six glowing skeletons, one neon scientist, and one very alive girl who believed in us.

A strange family.

But the right one.

The world was watching now.

And for the first time, we were ready.
